<p></p>
<h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound Impossible Beef</li>
    <li>6 scallions, white parts chopped, green parts sliced thin</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>

<p></p>
<h3><strong>Instructions</strong></s></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Cook "beef," scallion whites, and pepper in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until meat begins to sizzle in its own fat, about 10 minutes. Stir in chili powder, garlic, and cumin and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Stir in beans, water, and enchilada sauce and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
