<h2><strong>Why This Recipe Works</strong></h2>
<h4>Covering the squash speeds up its cooking while still allowing for browning.</h4>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound penne pasta</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 pound butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh sage leaves, torn</li>
    <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces</li>
    <li>1/4 cup hazelnuts, toasted, skinned, and chopped coarse</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>2 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Add pasta and 1 tablespoon salt to boiling water and cook, stirring often, until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup cooking water, then drain pasta and return it to pot.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add squash, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Cover and cook until squash is softened and browned, about 5 minutes. Add sage and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds; add squash mixture to pasta.</li>
    <p></p>
    <li>Add butter and hazelnuts to now-empty skillet and cook over medium-high heat until both are browned and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and stir in emon juice and 1/4 cup reserved cooking water (butter will foam and sizzle). Stir hazelnut mixture and 1/2 cup Parmesan into pasta and season with salt and pepper to taste. Adjust consistency with remaining reserved cooking water as needed. Serve, sprinkled with remaining 1/2 cup Parmesan.</li>
</ol>
