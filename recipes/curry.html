<h2><strong>Why This Recipe Works</strong></h2>
<h4>For a simple, vegetarian weeknight curry, we simmer canned chickpeas with tomatoes, spices, and coconut milk.</h4>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 red or yellow bell peppers, stemmed, seeded, and cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>1 jalapeno chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced</li>
    <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
    <li>2 (15-ounce) cans chickpeas, rinsed</li>
    <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can cocoanut milk</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oil in Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add bell peppers, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper and cook until bell peppers are beginning to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add jalapeno, garlic, ginger, and curry powder and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
